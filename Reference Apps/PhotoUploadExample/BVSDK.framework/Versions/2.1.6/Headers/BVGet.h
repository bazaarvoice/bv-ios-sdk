/*!
 BVGet is used for all requests to the Bazaarvoice API which fetch, but do not modify data on the server.  This includes fetching answers, authors, categories, comments, products, questions, reviews, statistics and stories.
 
 In the simplest case, a request might be created as follows:
 
BVGet *getReviewsRequest = [[ BVGet  alloc ] initWithType:BVGetTypeReviews ];  <br/>
[ getReviewsRequest sendRequestWithDelegate:self ];
 
 The specified delegate will then receive BVDelegate callbacks when a response is received.  Note that it is the client's responsibility to set the delegate to nil in the case that the the delegate is deallocated before a response is received.

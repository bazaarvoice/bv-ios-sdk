The Bazaarvoice SDK is an iOS static library that provides an easy way to generate REST calls to the Bazaarvoice API.

## SDK Organization:

The BVSDK is comprised of 4 main product features, also know as SDK modules. ALl features are initialized through a single SDK Manager: BVSDKManager. Each SDK product feature sits on top of two components required for all modules: BVCore and BVAnalytics.

The SDK modules are:

### BVAdvertising

Wraps the ability to use 1st party data for serving up custom DFP advertisements.

### BVConversations

### BVCurations

### BVRecommendations

### BV Pixel

BVAnalyics also includes the BV Pixel feature for analytics tracking of transaction and non-commerce analytics.

The Bazaarvoice SDK is an iOS static library that provides an easy way to generate REST calls to the Bazaarvoice API.

## SDK Organization:

The BVSDK is comprised of 3 main product features, also know as SDK modules. ALl features are initialized through a single SDK Manager: BVSDKManager. Each SDK product feature sits on top of two components required for all modules: BVCore and BVAnalytics.

The SDK modules are:

### BVAdvertising

When using the BVAdvertising module, there are three main types of advertisements you can dislay, all of which inherit from DFPBannerView:

  * BVTargetedBannerView
  * BVTargetedInterstitial
  * BVTargetedAdLoader

Please consult the [BVSDK Developer Wiki](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bv-ios-sdk/wiki) for more details on using the BVAdvertising SDK module.

### BVRecommendations

Once you have initialized the SDK with your API key and client ID with the BVSDKManager, the only class you will need to fetch targeted recommendations is found in BVGetShopperProfile. Recommendations will be found in the BVShopperProfile module, which you can use to display results to your end-users.

### BVRecommendationsUI

If you wish to supply any of the easy-to-use recommendation widgets, the three main UI widgets are:

 * BVRecommendationsCarouselView
 * BVRecommendationsSharedView
 * BVRecommendationsTableViewController

 For best introducts, please see the Recommendations UI tutorial on the [BVSDK Developer Wiki](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bv-ios-sdk/wiki).

### BVConversations

With the BVConverstaions SDK module, there are just 5 classes that the client needs to be familiar with.

#### BVSettings
Encapsulates all application-wide configuration information necessary to make requests via the Bazaarvoice SDK.  This includes things such as the base url, the passkey, whether to use staging and the request timeout interval.

#### BVGet
Handles all requests to the Bazaarvoice API which fetch, but do not modify data on the server.  This includes fetching answers, authors, categories, comments, products, questions, reviews, statistics and stories.

#### BVPost
Handles all requests to the Bazaarvoice API which submit content excluding photo and video uploads.  This includes submitting answers, review comments, story comments, feedback, questions, reviews and stories.

#### BVMediaPost
Handles all requests to the Bazaarvoice API which require a binary multipart post.  This includes submitting photos and videos.

#### BVDelegate
Delegate interface  to receive SDK callbacks when a response is received.  

## Making Requests
Conceptually, there are 5 steps to making a request the Bazaarvoice SDK:

 1. Allocate a request (BVGet, BVPost or BVMediaPost)
 2. Initialize with the appropriate type (ex: BVGetTypeReviews, BVPostTypeAnswer...)
 3. Set parameters of the request (ex: limit, sort, filter, title...)
 4. Set a BVDelegate to receive updates when a response is received
 5. Send

See the class documentation for BVGet, BVPost and BVMediaPost for example code.

## Older Versions

Older versions of the SDK are tagged according to version number.  You can list available versions with:<br />
<strong>git tag</strong>

In general, version 2.X.Y of the SDK maps to version 5.X of the API.  To check out a particular version, use: 	
<strong>git checkout [tag]</strong>

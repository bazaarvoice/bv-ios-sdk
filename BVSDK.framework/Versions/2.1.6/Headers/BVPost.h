/*!
 BVPost is used for all requests to the Bazaarvoice API which submit content excluding photo and video uploads.  This includes submitting answers, review comments, story comments, feedback, questions, reviews and stories.
 
 In the simplest case, a request might be created as follows:
 
 BVPost *questionRequest = [[ BVPost alloc ] initWithType:BVPostTypeQuestion ]; <br />
 questionRequest.categoryId = @"1020"; <br />
 ... <br />
 [ questionRequest sendRequestWithDelegate:self ];

 The specified delegate will then receive BVDelegate callbacks when a response is received.  Note that it is the client's responsibility to set the delegate to nil in the case that the the delegate is deallocated before a response is received.

// waiting on expectations that doesn't mean that Xcode won't start running
// other tests. So, for example, if you're kicking off tests which wait for
// notifications to be delivered and it's possible that other tests will spawn
// notifications that you're waiting for, well, then you can be hosed. So the
// way this works is that whenever you're entering a context you make a
// 'retainBarrier' call and whenever you leave you make a 'releaseBarrier' call.
// Of course, make sure they're balanced else you're error out.

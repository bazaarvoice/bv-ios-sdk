 Test case Scenarios:
 
 Both Pros and Cons are returned for a valid productId and clientId.
 Only Pros are returned and no Cons are returned for a valid productId and clientId.
 Only Cons are returned and no Pros are returned for a valid productId and clientId.
 No Pros and Cons are returned for a valid productId and clientId (Review count < 10, Excluding incentivised reviews review count < 10).
 The given productId is invalid. In this case a specific error should be returned.
 The given clientId is invalid. In this case a specific error should be returned.
 The clientId does not have RH enabled. In this case a specific error should be returned.
 Pros & Cons should not be mismatched.
 The sequence of the Pros and Cons should be the same as return in Response.

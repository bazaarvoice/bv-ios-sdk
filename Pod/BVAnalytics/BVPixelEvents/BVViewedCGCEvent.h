/**
 BVViewedCGCEvent should be used to indicate that UGC (User Generated Content) is visible on the screen and has been in the view for an designated amount of time. This event should only be fired once per lifetime of a ViewController. This differs from a BVInView event in that a delay should be provided (typically 5 seconds) to know that content is visible and readable on the screen.

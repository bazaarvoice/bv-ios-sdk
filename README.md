## Full SDK Documentation

For complete documentation, please refer to the [BVSDK Wiki](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bv-ios-sdk-dev/wiki).

## Introduction
The Bazaarvoice software development kit (BVSDK) for iOS is an iOS library that provides an easy way to generate REST calls to the Bazaarvoice Developer API. Using this SDK, mobile developers can quickly integrate Bazaarvoice content into their native iOS apps for iPhone and iPad on iOS 8 or newer. The BVSDK is built with modularity in maind so you can install only the components you want to work with. The primary BVSDK modules are:

### Conversations

The BVConverstaions module lets Developers display and submit content such as Ratings & Reviews, Ask & Answer and Stories, including text and photo. 

### Advertising

The BVAdvertising module allows use of Bazaarvoice's powerful shopper segment data with Google Mobile Ads. The BVAdvertising is architected so that you can use all aspects of the [DFP (Doubleclick For Publishers) SDK](https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/dfp/ios/quick-start) easily, with Bazaarvoice's shopper segment functionality built in.

>**NOTE:** Previous users of the [BVAdsSDK on github](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bv-ios-ads-sdk-dev) should update to the BVAdvertising module in this SDK.

### Recommendations

>**Product Recommendations is currently in BETA! If you would like to participate in the Beta Pilot Program, please contact [Mobile Development at Bazaarvoice](mailto:mobilecoreteam@bazaarvoice.com)**

The BVRecommendations allows developers to leverage Bazaarvoice's powerful Shopper Marketing product for targeted product recommendations. The BVRecommendationsUI module also allows developers to quickly build and skin UI components for quick integrations into mobile applications.

## Link to BVSDK Logs

Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your _full_ logs, and link them here.
Do _NOT_ paste your full logs here, as it will make this issue very long and hard to read!
If you are reporting a bug, _always_ include logs!

## Code To Reproduce Issue [ Very Good To Have ]

Please remember that with sample code it's easier to reproduce the bug and it's much faster to fix it.

Creating a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) with the sample is good but attaching a link to a compilable/runnable example is _better_.
